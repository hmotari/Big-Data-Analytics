# Big-Data-Analytics
This project helps businesses understand the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) which customers are most valuable by predicting how much money each customer will spend over time. By looking at customer information like age, salary and location, their buying history, we can estimate how much revenue each customer might bring in the future.
